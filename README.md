## Description

Kabana is a Kanban board for managing your tickets. If you have ever posted sticky notes on a whiteboard, you will know how to use Kabana. It has never been easier to adopt an agile workflow.

Highlights:

* Kanban board with full drag and drop support
* View tickets in context with sidebar mini board
* Prioritize tickets
* Customize board and workflow via custom ticket fields
* No-setup and no-signup required

Kabana provides one board per group with one column for each ticket status. Each ticket is represented as a card which shows the ticket number, title and current assignee. You can drag tickets and drop them onto a column to change the status.

Tickets are automatically assigned to the current agent when pulling them out of the ‘new’ column. Drag ticket to reorder and prioritize tickets within a status column to focus on important work items first. Kabana currently supports up to 100 tickets per column.

Kabana also supports custom workflows. You can use a custom ticket field for the workflow columns and board selection.
